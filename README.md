# NextStop Europe: Discover Your Ideal Travel Destination or New Home

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive tool that:
- Assists travelers in selecting the most suitable European destination based on their preferences.
- Helps relocants evaluate potential European cities for remote work and living based on key parameters like cost of living, quality of life, and connectivity.


## Overview
Welcome to the **NextStop Europe** project repository! This project was developed as part of the **final project** for the Data Science Bootcamp at **WBS Coding School.** The goal of this project is to help users make informed decisions about their next travel destination or potential relocation spot in Europe.


## Project Description
The project includes two interactive Tableau dashboards:

1. **Travelers Dashboard** üåç: Designed to assist users in selecting the perfect European travel destination based on various criteria. It provides insights to help travelers plan their trips more effectively.

2. **Relocants Dashboard** üè°: Tailored for those considering relocation within Europe. This dashboard provides key information on various parameters important for relocants, helping users choose the ideal location to live and work remotely.

## Challenges
- **Data Availability**: Finding comprehensive and up-to-date datasets that cover all the relevant parameters for travel and relocation decisions was challenging. We had to rely on multiple sources and combine them to create a cohesive dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Merging data from different sources required extensive cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency.
- **Visualization Complexity**: Designing dashboards that are both informative and easy to use, while effectively conveying complex data, was a significant challenge.
