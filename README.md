# NextStop Europe: Discover Your Ideal Travel Destination or New Home

## Overview
Welcome to the **NextStop Europe** project repository! This project was developed as part of the final project for the Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. The goal of this project is to help users make informed decisions about their next travel destination or potential relocation spot in Europe.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive tool that:
- Assists travelers in selecting the most suitable European destination based on their preferences.
- Helps relocants evaluate potential European cities for remote work and living based on key parameters like cost of living, quality of life, and connectivity.

## Project Description
The project includes two interactive Tableau dashboards:

1. **Travelers Dashboard** üåç: Designed to assist users in selecting the perfect European travel destination based on various criteria. It provides insights to help travelers plan their trips more effectively.

## Skills & Tools Used
- **Data Collection**: Web Scraping, Open APIs, Kaggle Datasets
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Microsoft AI Designer
- **Project Management**: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub

## Challenges
- **Data Availability**: Finding comprehensive and up-to-date datasets that cover all the relevant parameters for travel and relocation decisions was challenging. We had to rely on multiple sources and combine them to create a cohesive dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Merging data from different sources required extensive cleaning and normalization to ensure consistency.
- **Visualization Complexity**: Designing dashboards that are both informative and easy to use, while effectively conveying complex data, was a significant challenge.

## Future Scope
- **Expansion of Parameters**: Incorporating additional parameters such as more environmental factors, more languages, more cities.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Integrating real-time data updates to provide users with the latest information.
- **User Personalization**: Adding features that allow users to input their preferences for a more personalized experience.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimizing the dashboards for mobile devices to enhance accessibility and user experience.
